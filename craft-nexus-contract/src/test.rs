/// # Storage model
/// - Escrows are stored under `(ESCROW, order_id)` as a single compact record.
/// - Enumeration uses count + indexed keys (e.g. `EscrowCount` +
///   `GlobalEscrowIdIndexed(i)`) to avoid unbounded `Vec` growth.
///
/// # TTL model
/// - Persistent entries extend TTL on write via `extend_persistent`.
/// - Hot index reads use `extend_persistent_read` with a lower threshold to
///   reduce rent-refresh overhead while still preventing accidental expiry.
///
/// # Onboarding integration
/// - The admin can register an onboarding contract address.
/// - Cross-contract calls are wrapped in `try_invoke_contract` helpers so an
///   onboarding failure never bricks escrow settlement.
